# data structure and algorithm

## data type

there are two types of data types:

 **system-defined data types (also called primitive data types)**

    1.int, float, bool, char, double, etc,.. 
**user-defined data types** 

    1. if the system-defined data types are not enough, then most programming languages allow the users to define their own data-types, called user-data types
    2. this give more flexibility and comfort in dealing with computer memory
**data structure**

    we need some mechanism for manipulating that data to solve problems. Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in computer and storing data. A data structure is a special format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include arrays file, linked list, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and so on

    depending on the organization of the elements, data structures are classified into two types
        1. linear data structures: elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. Examples: linked list, stacks, queues
        2. non-linear data structures: elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. Examples: trees and graphs
